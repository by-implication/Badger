#Budget Badger

[_Budget Badger_](http://budgetbadger.ph) is a webapp that aims to help the public understand how their taxes are being spent, explore government works and allocated activities near them, and give feedback about specific projects.

The intial version was built in _~26 hours_ (pardon the mess!) for the first [#KabantayNgBayan](http://data.gov.ph/hackathon/) Open Data hackathon, using data provided by [data.gov.ph](http://kabantayngbayan.ph).

### Current features (in progress):

* Breakdown of the current budget by sector
	* Showing where your tax money goes
* Visualization of gov't works and projects
	* Filtering / searching projects
	* Mapping / location of projects
	* Providing feedback, ratings, and comments on projects
