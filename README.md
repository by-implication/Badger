#Budget Badger

_Budget Badger_ is a webapp that aims to help the public understand how their taxes are being spent, explore government works and projects near them, and give feedback.

The intial version was built in ~20 hours for the first #KabantayNgBayan Open Data hackathon, using data provided by [data.gov.ph](http://data.gov.ph).

_BB_ is written in Scala, and uses Play Framework and PostgreSQL. The front-end uses SASS, Bourbon + Neat, Leaflet, and AngularJS.
